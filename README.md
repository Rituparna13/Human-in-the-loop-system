LiveKit Voice AI Application – Real-time voice assistant built using LiveKit, OpenAI Realtime API, and TTS for two-way conversational audio.
The app is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and LiveKit SDK on the frontend.
The backend connects to OpenAI’s Realtime API for speech recognition, language understanding, and text-to-speech responses.
I’ve also implemented a LiveKit token API route to handle authentication securely.
